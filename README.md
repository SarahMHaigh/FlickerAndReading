# Flicker Slowing Reading Speed: Impacts on Migraine and the Visually Sensitive

By Caitlin A Laycox, Lauren Thompson, Arnold J Wilkins & Sarah M Haigh

The materials and Arduino code used in this study are listed here.

The Rate of Reading tests used are included in the HighLowRoR.pdf. The first three versions are the high autocorrelation tests (xx, xx, xx respectively) and the last three versions are the low autocorrelation tests (xx, xx, and xx respectively). The order of presetnations was counterbalanced.

The Flicker.ino file is for the Arduio board to instruct it to flicker at 60hz, 120Hz, or 60kHz in a counterbalanced order. PuTTy was used while the Arduino board was running to verify what flicker condition was being presented in real-time.

The demographic questionnaire, headache questionnaire, and Pattern Glare test documents are also included.
