# Flicker Slowing Reading Speed: Impacts on Migraine and the Visually Sensitive

By Caitlin A Laycox, Lauren Thompson, Arnold J Wilkins & Sarah M Haigh

The data, materials, and Arduino code used in this study are listed here.

The Rate of Reading tests used are included in the HighLowRoR.pdf. The first three versions are the high autocorrelation tests (0.4323248, 0.43479156, and 0.43224097 respectively) and the last three versions are the low autocorrelation tests (0.19215968, 0.19309188, and 0.18961608 respectively). The order of presetnations was counterbalanced. The code used to analyze the autocorrelation is included as a MATLAB file.

The Flicker.ino file is for the Arduio board to instruct it to flicker at 60hz, 120Hz, or 60kHz in a counterbalanced order. PuTTy was used while the Arduino board was running to verify what flicker condition was being presented in real-time.

The demographic questionnaire, headache questionnaire, and Pattern Glare test documents are also included.

Finally, the data for the two experiments are in FlickerData.xlsx. There were two raters for Experiment 1 and both of their data are contained in the spreadsheet under different tabs. The data from the second rater are analyzed in the Supplementary Materials that are linked in the paper.
